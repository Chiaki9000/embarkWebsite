                <p>We're an independent, student-centred not-for-profit, based out of Simon Fraser University,
                    creating space
                    for transformation by catalyzing student sustainability journeys that centre justice, equity,
                    decolonization, diversity and inclusion. </p>

                <p>We do this by engaging students in programs, events, and other initiatives that spark dialogue
                    and cultivate
                    action to address systemic challenges within our climate and food systems.</p>
